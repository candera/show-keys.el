# show-keys.el

A global minor mode for emacs that will show what keys you've typed in a window.

## Deprecation Notice

*N.B.* After I wrote this,
 [Jeff Weiss](https://plus.google.com/s/ergoemacs) pointed out
 [mwe-log-commands](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-zh/CommandLogMode)
 to me. As that does everything show-keys.el does and is more mature,
 I'm deprecating this project. Go get that one if you need what this
 does!
