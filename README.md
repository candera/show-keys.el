# show-keys.el

A global minor mode for emacs that will show what keys you've typed in a window.

## Caveat Hacker

I whipped this together in a giant hurry, but it seems to be stable enough.

## Installation

In your `.emacs`:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dir-with-show-keys.el/")
(require 'show-keys)
```
